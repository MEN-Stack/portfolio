Authenticaton:::

There are two ways to authenticate through GitHub REST API. 
Requests that require authentication will return 404 Not Found, 
instead of 403 Forbidden, in some places.

GitHub will discontinue authentication to the API using query parameters. 
Authenticating to the API should be done with HTTP basic authentication.
